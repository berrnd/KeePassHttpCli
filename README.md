# KeePassHttpCli

KeePassHttpCli is a command line client for accessing a [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) database through [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/).

I've searched for a KeePass command line client, found nothing - so I created this together with [KeePassHttpClient](https://github.com/berrnd/KeePassHttpClient).

Currently not every request type is implemented, see the usage examples below or the help screen.

## How to use
Mainly everything should be self explanatory through the help option, just start KeePassHttpCli.exe without any or with the `--help` parameter.

get-single-password: Get a single password in plain text (StdOut), if more than one entry is received, the first one is taken
```

## Usage examples
Associate a KeePass database, association info will be stored (encrypted, readable only by the currently logged in user) in `%localappdata%\KeePassHttpCli`)

`KeePassHttpCli.exe -a associate`

Get a single password as the output (StdOut), from an entry with a matching URL `google.com`, and the keep the console window open

`KeePassHttpCli.exe -a "get-single-password" -f url -s "google.com" -o`

Get a single password, from the first entry that matches the generic search `google` (like through the quick search box in KeePass)

`KeePassHttpCli.exe -a "get-single-password" -f any -s "google"`
